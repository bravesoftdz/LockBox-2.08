# LockBox-2.08
Version 2.08 of the source code from the old TurboPower open-sourced LockBox Library, upgraded to for Delphi 2010 and XE (32-bit only), but still contains all the old packages as well. This is maintained for compatibility of an existing application and I thought perhaps someone else might find it useful.

For other, probably more current versions of Lockbox and for 64-bit support, see the following repositories:

* [Jaro Lockbox2](https://github.com/jarto/lockbox2)
* [TurboPack LockBox](https://github.com/TurboPack/LockBox)
* [TurboPack LockBox3](https://github.com/TurboPack/LockBox3)
