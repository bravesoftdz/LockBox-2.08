# LockBox-2.08
Version 2.08 of the source code from the old TurboPower open-sourced LockBox Library, upgraded to for Delphi 2010 and XE (32-bit only).

This is maintained for compatibility of an existing application and I thought perhaps someone else might find it useful. The .INC file supports earlier versions of Delphi and the packages could be easily modified to work with them.

For other, probably more current versions of Lockbox and for 64-bit support, see the following repositories:

* [Jaro Lockbox2](https://github.com/jarto/lockbox2)
* [TurboPack LockBox](https://github.com/TurboPack/LockBox)
* [TurboPack LockBox3](https://github.com/TurboPack/LockBox3)
